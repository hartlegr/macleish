Our goal was to determine where Smith College could create two additional campsites at the MacLeish Field Station to accomodate a higher number of campers and a wider variety of camping environments.

Though the property of MacLeish spans 240 acres, the number of locations for possible campsites that meet the specified criteria is limited. In order to discover these hidden getaways, we plotted various landmarks and features of the land. 


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(leaflet)

base_plot <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
#  addPolylines(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "streams")) %>%
  addPolylines(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "boundary"), col = "black", weight = 3)%>%
  #addPolygons(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "forests"))%>%
#  addPolylines(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "trails"), col = "green")%>%
#  addMarkers(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "challenge_courses"), popup = ~cmt)%>%
#  addPolygons(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "research"), col = "orange")%>%
  addPolygons(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "wetlands"), col = "red", weight = 2)
 
```


#Markers for campsites, research, and parking:
```{r}
camp_plot <- 
  base_plot %>% 
addMarkers(lng = -72.678154, lat =  42.450976, popup = "Group Campsite") %>%
 addMarkers(lng = -72.679581, lat = 42.458549, popup = "Remote Campsite") %>%
 addMarkers(lng = -72.680663, lat = 42.448013, popup = "Parking")%>%
 addMarkers(lng = -72.680315, lat = 42.449653, popup = "OrchardMet Weather Station")%>%
 addMarkers(lng = -72.680553, lat = 42.448470, popup = "WhatelyMet Weather Station")

camp_plot


```
Here we have outlined the MacLeish property with the gray line, and marked the locations of the two existing campsites. The two weather stations and the parking lot are also shown as reference points, as well as the wetlands shown in red. 

#Add circle around parking lot with a 0.5 mile radius:
```{r}
parking_buffer <- base_plot %>%
  addCircles(lng = -72.680663 , lat = 42.448013, weight = 1,
    radius = 804)

parking_buffer

```
Any point along the outside of the circle is 0.5 miles from the parking lot. We decided to put one site at 0.5 miles away (Woods Romp) and another slightly closer (Cow Camp), which caters both towards groups that don't want to walk far to their site and groups that want to incorporate a bit of a trek in their trip. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
proj4_aea <- "+proj=aea +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +lat_0=37.5 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs"


```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
stream_buffer <- macleish_layers %>%
  pluck("streams") %>%
  st_transform(proj4_aea) %>%
  st_buffer(dist = 200) %>%
  st_transform(4326)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
research_buffer <- macleish_layers %>%
  pluck("research")%>%
  st_transform(proj4_aea)%>%
  st_buffer(dist = 500) %>%
  st_transform(4326)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
challenge_buffer <- macleish_layers %>% 
  pluck("challenge_courses")%>%
  st_transform(proj4_aea)%>%
  st_buffer(dist = 500)%>%
  st_transform(4326)
```

```{r}
  cowIcon <- makeIcon(iconUrl = "http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/iconsmind/outline/128/Cow-icon.png", iconWidth = 35, iconHeight = 40)

TreeIcon <- makeIcon(iconUrl = "http://icons.iconarchive.com/icons/iconsmind/outline/128/Tree-3-icon.png", iconWidth = 40, iconHeight = 40)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
forests1 <- macleish_layers%>%
  pluck("forests")%>%
  filter(!is.na(VegType_21))%>%
  group_by(VegType_21)%>%
  summarize(N = n())

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = "inferno", 
  domain = forests1$VegType_21
)
```
#Mapped vegetation types:
```{r}
treeplot <- base_plot%>%
  addPolygons(data = forests1, color = ~pal(VegType_21), weight = 1)%>%
  addMarkers(lng = -72.678154, lat =  42.450976, popup = "Group Campsite") %>%
 addMarkers(lng = -72.679581, lat = 42.458549, popup = "Remote Campsite")

treeplot
```
Next, we mapped color onto the type of vegetation to see what type of forest layer each of the existing sites has.

#Campsites with vegetation type:
```{r}
treeplot %>%
  addMarkers(lng = -72.679210, lat =  42.444697, popup = "Cow Camp", icon = cowIcon)%>%
  addMarkers(lng = -72.683844, lat =  42.455057, popup = "Woods Romp", icon = TreeIcon)

```
Here is the first look at two proposed sites in relation to the vegetation type mapping. Notice that the type of vegetation at Cow Camp (cow icon) and Woods Romp (pine tree icon) are different from the two existing sites, which we still see. This promises four distinct environments to experience within mere miles of each other.

#Buffer from streams:
```{r}
base_plot %>%
  addPolygons(data = stream_buffer)%>%
  addMarkers(lng = -72.679210, lat =  42.444697, popup = "Cow Camp", icon = cowIcon)%>%
  addMarkers(lng = -72.683844, lat =  42.455057, popup = "Woods Romp", icon = TreeIcon)

```
Notice that the existing sites aren't on the map anymore. It is necessary to consider their proximity to the streams, so adding buffers around them ensures that our sites fall within 200 feet of a stream. It's also worth noting that both of our proposed locations are not in the wetlands, so there is no need to worry about a damp departure!



#Contours:
```{r}
base_plot%>%
  addMarkers(lng = -72.679210, lat =  42.444697, popup = "Cow Camp", icon = cowIcon)%>%
  addMarkers(lng = -72.683844, lat =  42.455057, popup = "Woods Romp", icon = TreeIcon)%>%
  addPolygons(data = pluck(macleish_layers, "contours_3m"), col = "red", weight = 0.5)
  

```
No matter how perfect the locale is in terms of proximity to parking, water accessibility, and diversity in tree canopy, a campsite on a significant slant is no one's cup of tea. To account for this, we checked that the topography of MacLeish was within reason at each of the proposed sites. Here, we have mapped the 3m contours and show that both sites are in relatively flat areas. 

These spots are seemingly perfect for a night under the stars. One site, however, has a hidden bonus (or hitch). Cow Camp is in an area that cattle traverse frequently. No matter what one's bovine beliefs are, this is an incredibly authenthic experience (but be forewarned!).

With this information available, Smith should consider implementing these areas as potential campsites. 30 students in total can be accomodated at MacLeish on any given night currently. Though this is impressive, it is not nearly as high a proportion of the total Smith population as it should be in order to ensure that MacLeish is utilized to the max. Adding additional sites will allow for more students to learn from the space without crowding the exisiting sites. Plus, these sites might appeal to individuals in ways that the existing sites do not (i.e. an affinity for cows, a desire be a little farther off the grid). 

Smith should take our findings, and make sure that what we found from the data is empirically true/practical. Assuming that everything is in order, this project would not take long. To minimize environmental impact, we would not cut down any trees or build anything around these sites. They are both near existing trails, so no new trails would need to be built. Ideally, campers would be able to set up camp as soon as the location is approved. The only real concern is disrupting the cow commute, which ought to be considered as any other "wild" animals.
